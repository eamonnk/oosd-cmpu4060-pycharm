# Exercise 1 - Write a Python script that produces the following output on the console:
# **********
# *        *
# *        *
# *        *
# **********

# -- SOLUTION --
# Using print command to display square shape composed of asterisks and \n escape sequence to wrap to a new line to allow output 
# to be completed in a single print function rather than multiple print commands, making it more efficient
print("**********\n*        *\n*        *\n*        *\n**********")
